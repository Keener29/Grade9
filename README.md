# üéÆ Code Vault Escape Room üéÆ

Welcome to the **Code Vault Escape Room** - an exciting 30-minute coding challenge for kids!

## üìñ Story

You're trapped in a digital vault! To escape, you must fix bugs in 6 different puzzle files. Each puzzle represents a locked door or obstacle blocking your path. Fix all the bugs to unlock the exit!

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Setup

**For students bringing their own computers:**

1. **Get the code:**
   - Go to the GitHub repository (instructor will provide link)
   - Click the green **"Code"** button
   - Click **"Download ZIP"**
   - Extract the ZIP file to your Desktop or Documents folder

2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer
   - Check by running: `python3 --version` or `python --version`
   - If you don't have it: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3. Navigate to the folder in your terminal/command prompt
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/Grade9  # Mac/Linux
   cd Desktop\Grade9    # Windows
   ```

4. Run the escape room game:
   ```bash
   python escape_room.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 escape_room.py
   ```

### How to Play

1. **Read the clues**: Each puzzle file (`puzzle1.py` through `puzzle6.py`) contains clues about what bugs need to be fixed.

2. **Open the puzzle files to edit them**: 
   - **Windows**: Right-click `puzzle1.py` ‚Üí "Open with" ‚Üí **Notepad**
   - **Mac**: Right-click `puzzle1.py` ‚Üí "Open with" ‚Üí **TextEdit**
   - **Linux**: Right-click ‚Üí Open with **Text Editor**
   - **No special IDE needed!** Any text editor works perfectly fine.

3. **Find and fix the bugs**: Look for:
   - Missing punctuation (colons, parentheses, quotes)
   - Wrong variable names (typos, wrong names)
   - Missing imports
   - Logic errors (wrong comparisons, off-by-one errors)
   - Wrong operators (using + instead of -, * instead of /)

4. **Edit the puzzle files**: 
   - Open `puzzle1.py` (and others) in any text editor
   - Fix the bugs by editing the code
   - Save your changes

5. **Test your fixes**: After fixing a puzzle, you can either:
   - Run it directly: `python puzzle1.py`
   - Check it in the main game: Run `python escape_room.py` and choose which puzzle to check

6. **Complete all puzzles**: Fix all 6 puzzles to escape the vault!

**Note:** You'll be editing the puzzle files (puzzle1.py, puzzle2.py, etc.) in a simple text editor. Each file has bugs you need to fix!

## üéØ Puzzle Overview

- **Puzzle 1**: Syntax errors (missing colons, wrong indentation)
- **Puzzle 2**: Missing imports and wrong variable names
- **Puzzle 3**: Logic errors (wrong comparisons, loop ranges)
- **Puzzle 4**: Typos and wrong function/variable names
- **Puzzle 5**: Wrong mathematical operators
- **Puzzle 6**: String slicing and method name errors

## üí° Tips for Success

- **Read error messages carefully**: They tell you exactly what's wrong!
- **Check your spelling**: Python is case-sensitive (RED is different from red)
- **Look at the comments**: Many clues are in the comments near the bugs
- **Start with Puzzle 1**: They get progressively more challenging
- **Don't give up**: Debugging is like being a detective - look for clues!

## üéì Learning Objectives

After completing this escape room, you'll have experience with:
- Finding and fixing syntax errors
- Understanding Python imports
- Debugging logic errors
- Recognizing common coding mistakes
- Using Python to solve problems

## üèÜ When You Complete All Puzzles

You'll receive your **escape code** and can celebrate being a coding champion!

## üìù For Instructors

The bugs are intentionally placed and cover common beginner mistakes:
1. Missing colons after function definitions and if statements
2. Missing imports (random module)
3. Wrong variable names due to typos
4. Logic errors (wrong loop ranges, comparison operators)
5. Wrong mathematical operators
6. String slicing syntax and method name errors

Each puzzle can be solved by reading the comments and understanding the expected behavior. Estimated completion time: 25-35 minutes for grade 9 students.

## üêõ Need Help?

If you're really stuck:
1. Read the comments in each puzzle file - they have hints!
2. Check the error messages when you run the code
3. Compare what the code does vs. what it should do
4. Ask your instructor for guidance on specific puzzles

Good luck, and happy coding! üöÄ
