## 💡 Teaching Tips

### Pacing (30 minutes):
- **0-5 min**: Setup and getting code downloaded
- **5-25 min**: Working through puzzles
- **25-30 min**: Celebration and sharing solutions

### Encourage:
- Reading error messages carefully
- Looking at comments for hints
- Testing after each fix
- Helping each other (pair programming encouraged!)

### If Students Get Stuck:
- Refer them to comments in puzzle files
- Check QUICK_START.md for basic debugging tips
- Use SOLUTION_GUIDE.md to give subtle hints
- Have them explain what they think the code should do vs. what it's doing

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Python not found" / "python: command not found"
- Try `python3` instead of `python`
- On Windows: May need to add Python to PATH during installation
- Solution: Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH"

### "No module named X"
- Usually means a puzzle file has an error
- That's part of the challenge! Have them fix the bug

### "SyntaxError" 
- Perfect! That's a bug they need to fix
- Have them read the error message carefully

### Can't download from GitHub
- Fallback: Use Google Drive or USB drive
- Or: Share files directly via email/Slack
